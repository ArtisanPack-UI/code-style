# AI Guidelines

## Code Style (artisanpack-ui-code-style)

**Primary Goal:** To enforce strict adherence to the ArtisanPack UI coding standards for all generated PHP and JavaScript code.

### Core Principles for the AI:

**Consistency:** All generated code must be consistent with the rules defined in the Code Style document.

**Readability:** Code should be well-formatted and easy to read, with clear and descriptive naming conventions.

**Documentation:** All code must be thoroughly documented in accordance with WordPress documentation standards.

### Specific Instructions for the AI:

- All generated PHP code must follow the specified conventions, including Yoda conditionals, PascalCase for classes, camelCase for functions and variables, and snake_case for table columns.

- All generated JavaScript code must adhere to the defined standards, including the use of `let` and `const` instead of `var`, consistent semicolon usage, and proper formatting for objects and arrays.

- For all functions, classes, and methods, generate comprehensive documentation that follows the WordPress PHPDoc and JSDoc standards, including `@param`, `@return`, and `@since` tags.

- When asked to review or refactor existing code, identify any deviations from the established code style and provide corrections.
